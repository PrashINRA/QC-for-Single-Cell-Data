# QC-for-Single-Cell-Data
By default Quality Control setup of Seurat could be difficult for setting cutoffs to filter out low quality cells. 
Here I suggest and an alternative way to do this in R. I am using a dataset of AIM+ and AIM- cells from adult and infant donors, 
which are covid positive or negative.
